# How I worked on this project

### My goal on this project was to make an algorithm which is handles a diagnostic task through the use of a rule-based system of 10-20 rules.

# How to navigate this project

### The C++ main file prompts the user a list of questions regarding nutrition health. There are four options, Skin, Bones, Eyes, and Hair, each of which is classified in their own header file, leading the user to a deeper set of questions which will result in the program telling them what they should do to solve their problem

# Why I built the project this way

### I created separate header files for each of the categories for the purpose of neat coding and better organization. 

# If I had more time I would change this

### I would take advantage of Qt Creator to give this application a GUI framework
